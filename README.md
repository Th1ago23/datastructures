# Understanding Algorithms - Practice

This repository was created to practice the concepts from the book **Understanding Algorithms** by Aditya Bhargava. Here, examples and exercises covered in the book will be implemented using different programming languages.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Chapter 1 - Introduction to Algorithms**
- **Chapter 2 - Sorting and Searching**
- **Chapter 3 - Recursion**
- **Chapter 4 - Divide and Conquer**
- **Chapter 5 - Data Structures**
- **Chapter 6 - Graph Algorithms**
- **Chapter 7 - Dynamic Programming**
- **Chapter 8 - Advanced Algorithms**

Each folder contains commented code and explanations about the covered algorithms.

## Technologies Used

The algorithms will be implemented using different programming languages, including:

- `Java`
